\chapter{The Basic Clause}
\label{ch:clause}

Before I turn to the meat of this dissertation, the multi-predicate constructions present in Nuuchahnulth, I will first give an overview of the language's basic clause structure and define some important terminology and lexical-syntactic distinctions present in the language. I will begin with the predicate/participant distinction (\S\ref{sec:clause:predp}, \S\ref{sec:clause:partp}), an important syntactic split which roughly maps to how verbs and nouns are used in English, but subsumes many lexical categories in Nuuchahnulth. I will then describe some special cases in which participant ordering is altered (\S\ref{sec:clause:partorder}). Finally I will look at second-position clausal clitics (\S\ref{sec:clause:cliticnormal}), and how the syntactic properties of Nuuchahnulth require special attention when modeling in HPSG (\S\ref{sec:clause:cliticmodifier}). I will interleave HPSG-style analyses with the data, but the descriptive facts should be available to linguists working in other formalisms.

\section{Syntactic Predicates} \label{sec:clause:predp}

Like many languages of the Pacific Northwest, Nuuchahnulth is predicate-initial and has a great deal of flexibility with respect to what parts of speech can be used predicatively \citep{jacobsen1979}. Because the term ``predicate" and its associated derivations (``predicative" and so on) are often ambiguous between syntactic and semantic concepts, I have found that linguists often talk past each other when trying to describe the syntax of the languages of South Wakashan. Throughout this work I will use special vocabulary to try to reduce this confusion.

I will reserve the word \textit{predicate} to refer to the syntactic component that heads a clause and connects components like subject and object to one another. In English, a syntactic predicate must be verbal, as in (\ref{ex:dogbarks},\ref{ex:grassgreen}). The verb `barks' serves as the predicate of (\ref{ex:dogbarks}), connecting it to the subject `the dog.' In (\ref{ex:grassgreen}), `is' serves as the sentential predicate, connecting its subject `the grass' to the complement `green.' I will refer to the units that predicates connect as \textit{participants}---this term encompasses both subject and complements. The sole participant of (\ref{ex:dogbarks}) is `the dog', and the participants of (\ref{ex:grassgreen}) are `the grass' and `green'.

\ex \label{ex:dogbarks}
[The dog]\textsubscript{participant} [barks]\textsubscript{predicate}.
\xe

\ex~ \label{ex:grassgreen}
[The grass]\textsubscript{participant} [is]\textsubscript{predicate} [green]\textsubscript{participant}.
\xe

In contrast to \textit{predicate} and \textit{participant}, which are syntactic concepts, I will use \textit{relation} and \textit{argument} to refer to their correlates in compositional semantics. The \textit{relation} is the atomic semantic unit that relates arguments to each other, typically represented with capital letters. For example, in (\ref{ex:dogbarks}), the English word \textit{barks} has the relation \textsc{bark}. Every semantically contentful morpheme has a relation, including syntactic participants (\textsc{dog}, \textsc{grass}, \textsc{green}).

Relations have some number of semantic \textit{arguments}. For example, \textsc{bark} can be modeled with two arguments: the event of barking, and the barker. This could be represented in a Neodavidsonian manner as \textsc{bark}(\textit{e}, \textit{x}). Note that the relation itself \textsc{bark} is at least conceptually separate from the number and type of its arguments. When I find it important to highlight the separation between the semantic relation and the number of its arguments, I may also refer to the relation as a \textit{predicate symbol}.\footnote{From terminology used by the DELPH-IN consortium. \url{http://moin.delph-in.net/ErgSemantics/Basics}} This semantic scheme is a simplification of the fuller semantic model that I will use later, Minimal Recursion Semantics \citep{copestake2005}.

It is important to keep in mind that the number of arguments that a semantic relation has is separate from its syntactic properties. The English predicate \textit{barks} may be represented as a semantic relation with two arguments \textsc{bark}(\textit{e}, \textit{x}). However, the syntactic non-predicate \textit{green} can be modeled in the same way: \textsc{green}(\textit{e}, \textit{x}). The syntactic properties of \textit{barks} and \textit{green}---predicate vs participant, which in English is straightforwardly subsumed into the verb vs adjective distinction---is separable from their semantic properties.

Though Nuuchahnulth has syntactic categories like verb, noun, and adjective, any of these may function as syntactic predicate or participant depending on where they fall in the sentence. The terms ``verb phrase," ``noun phrase," and ``adjective phrase" are valid insofar as they refer to a phrase headed by a verb, noun, or adjective, but they are not illuminating for determining syntactic roles, as any of these categories may be predicates.

In (\ref{ex:verbpred}), the verb \textit{n̓aacsiičiƛ} `see' is serving as the clausal predicate, while the clause \textit{hałmiiḥa quuʔas} `drowning person' is serving as the participant. In (\ref{ex:adjpred}), the adjective \textit{qʷac̓ał} `beautiful' is the predicate of the sentence, while the noun \textit{ḥaakʷaaƛ} `young girl' is the participant. In (\ref{ex:nounpred}) the noun \textit{pisatuwił} `gym' is the predicate and there are no participants. In this case, postposed \textit{ʔaanaḥi} `only' is a predicate-modifying adverb and not fulfilling any argument role of the relation \textsc{gym}.

\begin{comment}
While all three words have semantic relations (\textsc{see}, \textsc{drown}, \textsc{person}), only one is the syntactic predicate of the sentence.

Descriptively, it is sufficient to say that nouns, verbs, and adjectives may all be clausal predicates in Nuuchahnulth, in the same way that English requires clausal predicates to be verbs. Importantly, this data (including the modifying adverb in (\ref{ex:nounpred})), along with evidence from participant clauses (\S\ref{sec:clause:partp}), is sufficient to claim that nouns are events in Nuuchahnulth \citep{inman2018}. I will give my method for modeling this in (\S\ref{sec:clause:analysis}).

\section{Syntactic Participants} \label{sec:clause:partp}

Just as verbs, nouns, and adjectives may all be predicates, they may also all be participants. Example (\ref{ex:adjpred}) showed a straightforwardly nominal participant, the noun and article \textit{ḥaakʷaaƛʔi} `the young girl.' However, verbs (\ref{ex:verbpart}) and adjectives (\ref{ex:adjpart}) may also serve as participants.

\endgl
\xe

%\noindent TODO: confirm that (\ref{ex:adjpart}) is okay for sharing permissions, from a version of the Only Teachings.

As detailed in \cite{jacobsen1979} and \cite{wojdak2001}, when an adjective or verb is used as a participant, as in (\ref{ex:verbpart}, \ref{ex:adjpart}), the article \textit{=ʔiˑ} is required to make the sentence grammatical. When the participant is headed by a common noun, as in (\ref{ex:verbpred}), the article is optional. Proper nouns differentiate themselves from common nouns in that they may never take the article \citep{inman2018}. They are also never in predicate position.

My analysis of these facts is that the article \textit{=ʔiˑ} is in fact a relativizer that creates a participant from a notional predicate \cite{inman2018}.\footnote{This ultimately is original to Werle, \textit{p.c.}, who has also documented that \textit{=ʔiˑ} is morphologically in the same position as mood portmanteaus, and has supplanted the third person definite mood in some dialects.} Noun phrases may be relativized without the article, but other predicate phrases must be headed by the relativizing second position article \textit{=ʔiˑ}. That is, the semantics of the verb \textit{kamatquk} `run' and the noun \textit{pisatuwił} `gym' look like:

\ex~
\textsc{run}(\textit{e}, \textit{x})

\textsc{gym}(\textit{e}, \textit{x})
\xe

The event variable \textit{e} allows for tense, aspect, mood, and evidentiality values (TAME). This \textit{e} is also necessary for adverbial modification, which both verbs and nouns can undergo. However, when either type of word is used as a participant in the syntax, it is the variable (\textit{x}) that is needed by the semantics. \textit{=ʔiˑ} provides the relativizing function to accomplish this for all predicate types, and common nouns may undergo this process without an overt \textit{=ʔiˑ} attached. The analytical mechanisms for this will be addressed more fully in \S\ref{sec:clause:analysis}.

%\section{Participant Ordering} \label{sec:clause:partorder}

There is a strong tendency in Nuuchahnulth for each clause to have one overtly-expressed participant \citep[38]{rose1981} but if there are two participants expressed, they can come in any order. There is a preference in the southernmost dialects (Barkley sound and Central) for VSO ordering \citep[267]{jacobsen1993}, and a preference in the northern dialects (Northern and Kyuquot) for VOS ordering (Werle, \textit{p.c.}). This preference is not absolute, and to make the sentence unambiguous, speakers can use \textit{ʔuukʷił} to mark any non-highest argument \citep{woo2007b}.

\subsection{Participant Fronting}

It is possible for speakers to move a participant in front of the predicate for focus, as in (\ref{ex:focus}). This left-dislocated participant is notably outside the calculation for second position inflection (\S\ref{sec:clause:cliticnormal}).

\ex \label{ex:focus}
\begingl
\glpreamble ƛ̓aaq ʔuʔaatamin, waaʔaƛweʔin quʔušin. //
\gla ƛ̓aaq ʔu-ʔaˑta=(m)in waa=!aƛ=weˑʔin quʔušin //
\glb oil \textsc{x}-lack=\textsc{real.1pl} say=\textsc{now}=\textsc{hrsy.3} raven //
\glft ` ``We need oil," said Raven.' (\textbf{B}, Marjorie Touchie) //
\endgl
\xe

Wh-words and phrases also front, obligatorily, as in (\ref{ex:howmanydays}). In this case, the second position enclitics attach to the wh-word, so this fronting is ``inside" the second position calculation.

\ex \label{ex:howmanydays}
\begingl
\glpreamble qum̓aačłnik hił c̓uumaʕaas. //
\gla qum̓aa-čiˑł=nik hił c̓uumaʕaas //
\glb how.many-day=\textsc{pst.ques.2sg} be.at Port.Alberni //
\glft `How many days were you in Port Alberni?' (\textbf{Q}, Sophie Billy) //
\endgl
\xe

In addition to wh-words and focused participants, quantifiers tend to front as well (\ref{ex:uushilnofront}, \ref{ex:uushilfront}). It is possible in this case for the fronted quantifier to be either outside the syntactic scope of the second position enclitics (\ref{ex:uushilfront}) or inside it (\ref{ex:hishukfront}).

\ex \label{ex:uushilnofront}
\begingl
\glpreamble haʔukquuʔaała ʔuušił haʔum. //

\endgl

\glb all-\textsc{now}=\textsc{strg.3}=\textsc{pl} run-\textsc{dr} //
\glft `Everyone is running.' (\textbf{N}, Fidelia Haiyupis) //
\endgl
\xe

I have not done a deep investigation into the conditions that determine whether the second position complex falls on the fronted quantifier or on the following predicate. In fact, this may vary by quantifier type. I have examples in my data of the fronted quantifier \textit{ʔuuš} taking the clitics (\ref{ex:uushfrontclitic}) or not (\ref{ex:uushfrontnoclitic}).

\ex \label{ex:uushfrontclitic}

\glft `If he is going to be pointer, they look to see if they put (someone) in a tree, if someone has passed away.' (\textbf{C}, \textit{tupaat} Julia Lucas) //

\glft `I also saw some at Tofino.' (\textbf{C}, \textit{tupaat} Julia Lucas) //
\endgl
\xe

This same pattern with respect to \textit{ʔuuš} is present in Sapir's original data.\footnotemark{} \textit{ʔuušił}, which is \textit{ʔuuš} `some' with the object marking \textit{-L.(č)ił} attached, behaves the same way in my data. \textit{ʔuušił} may be fronted without the second position enclitics, as already seen in (\ref{ex:uushilfront}), or it may then take the enclitics, as in (\ref{ex:uushilfrontclitic}) below. I could not find any \textit{ʔuušił} fronting in the Nootka Texts, so \textit{ʔuušił} fronting may represent a change in the language in the intervening generations.

\endgl
\xe

I have no examples of the strong quantifier \textit{hišuk} `all' fronting without the second position complex, and it is possibly ungrammatical. The version of the strong quantifier in the Nootka texts, \textit{č̓uučk}, does not occur in a fronting environment where the enclitics unambiguously fall on the following predicate. (That is, in a case where the enclitic could not be a singly null-marked third person morpheme.)

My provisional analysis of these facts is to describe two types of fronting: (i) focus-fronting, which falls outside the calculation for second position enclitics and adds focus information to a word; and (ii) non-focus fronting, which falls inside the second position calculation and does not add focus. Non-focus fronting does not mean that the word is necessarily not focused, only that its left-extracted position is not giving it focus. This is significant as, according to many analyses, wh-words must be focused \citep[Chapter 5]{lambrecht1996}. Table \ref{table:fronting} gives the parts of speech that are compatible with each type of fronting.

\begin{table}[h]
\caption{Fronting properties of different words}
\begin{tabular}{l|l|l|l|l|} 
\cline{2-5}
                                         & nouns                & weak quantifiers      & strong quantifiers    & wh-words              \\ \hline
\multicolumn{1}{|l|}{Focus fronting}     & \cmark & \cmark & \xmark & \xmark \\ \hline
\multicolumn{1}{|l|}{Non-focus fronting} & \xmark & \cmark & \cmark & \cmark \\ \hline
\end{tabular} \label{table:fronting}
\end{table}

This discussion should not be considered definitive with respect to fronting and quantifier fronting in particular. Notably absent is \textit{ʔaya} `many', which I predict would pattern with \textit{hišuk}, but have not investigated. The claims with respect to the difference between \textit{hišuk} and \textit{ʔuuš} need checking, as well as claims about the status of these elements as having focus or not. For the purpose of this dissertation, I am only attempting to list the exceptions to the general rule that syntactic participants follow their predicate. Each of these cases is a special deviation from that general rule, and only happens under particular circumstances. I will ultimately model these as different types of extraction (\S\ref{sec:clause:analysis}).

%In addition to the special focus construction above, dependent clauses may realize their participants to the left without any special focus.

%TODO: Adam believes that participant-predicate ordering is possible in dependent clauses, citing ʔuyi. I believe that ʔuyi is an incipient adposition, and this is a postposition structure in these cases. It is extremely hard (impossible?) to find clear dependent clause participant-predicate ordering outside of ʔuyi. Ask Adam if he knows of non-ʔuyi examples.

\section{Second-position clitics} \label{sec:clause:cliticnormal}

The majority of clausal inflection in Nuuchahnulth is in a complex of second position enclitics which attach to the first word of the clause, modulo the left extraction seen in \S\ref{sec:clause:partp}. Table \ref{table:2pclitics} shows the ordering of the clitic complex, and is adapted from Adam Werle's grammar reference. A fuller list of these enclitics is given in Appendix \ref{appendix:grams}.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Order of second position clitics}
\label{table:2pclitics}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\cline{2-11}

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

The \textit{=$\emptyset$} morpheme, which indicates the third-person neutral mood, merits some special attention. While there is no phonological element associated with this inflection, all of the other enclitics appear in their typical order around where it would be. A predicate with no enclitic, or with one or more of the non-subject-mood enclitics (such as past, or habitual and plural) is always interpreted as being in the neutral mood with a third person subject. I do not put a \textit{=$\emptyset$} in my gloss lines, except below in (\ref{ex:2padjpart}) to show that it is notionally present. The syntactic information about neutral mood and 3rd person subject has to come from somewhere and this can be modeled as a phonologically empty morpheme providing it. I address this more in the implementation section (\S\ref{sec:clause:analysis}).

The examples I have given so far have all shown this clitic complex attaching directly to the clausal predicate. However, it may also attach to preceding adverbial modifiers (\ref{ex:2padvpred}), conjunctions (\ref{ex:2pconjpred}), and adpositions (\ref{ex:2padppred}).\footnote{The claim that (\ref{ex:2padppred}) is an adposition is somewhat controversial. \cite{woo2007b} analyzes these as little-\textit{v}, a category which does not exist in HPSG analyses. What this unit does is mark participants that fulfill a certain role with respect to the verb, similar to case-marking. An analysis that treats this particle as an adposition can generate the same set of sentences as a little-\textit{v} analysis, and is necessary within the HPSG framework. In this model, non-agentive arguments may be realized by a Participant Phrase or an Adposition Phrase headed by \textit{-L.(č)ił}. This means that in (\ref{ex:2padppred}), the word \textit{hiišił} is an adposition phrase modifying the following verb \textit{ʔiiqḥuk}.} Likewise, the relativizing enclitic article (\S\ref{sec:clause:partp}) may also attach to a preceding modifying adjective (\ref{ex:2padjpart}) and not directly to the head noun, as seen in (\ref{ex:adjpred}).

%[[TODO: Find a two-word analytic \textit{ʔuukʷił} version of (\ref{ex:2padppred}), which only has the suffix version \textit{-L.čił}.]].

Every clause in Nuuchahnulth contains an enclitic, even if it is only the notional =$\emptyset$ third person neutral enclitic. With the exception fo extraction (\S\ref{sec:clause:partp}), the enclitic always appears on the first word of the clause, which is either the predicate or a preceding adverb. Together with the restrictions on syntactic predicates, I use this data to claim that the clitic complex is the syntactic head of the clause in Nuuchahnulth, and the clitic complex then selects for predicates. That is, the second position enclitic complex is the auxiliary head of a clause, and inherits its valence (number of complements) from the predicate, which also provides the main semantic relation of the clause. Because of its second position properties, this analysis of the Nuuchahnulth clitic requires some special attention in HPSG (\S\ref{sec:clause:analysis}), but descriptively I can stop at calling the enclitic complex the head of the Nuuchahnulth clause.

One final fact about the clause worth mentioning is clitic spreading. The presence of a clitic \textit{in situ} within the second position complex is required. If the clause is passive, the passive morpheme must appear within the complex, and so on. However, some of these clitics may appear multiply within a clause: first in the second position enclitic complex, and then later on the predicate or predicates of the sentence. This occurs in cases where there is a preposed adposition\footnote{For the argument that \textit{ʔuyi} is an adposition, see \S\ref{sec:link:uyi}.} (\ref{ex:doubleatluyi}), a preposed adverb (\ref{ex:doubleatlyuuqwaa}, \ref{ex:doubleap}), a preposed quantifier (\ref{ex:doubleatuush}),\footnote{Note that in this instance the quantifier has a linker attached. The semantics of the linker will be addressed in \S\ref{sec:link}.} or a clefting construction (\ref{ex:doubleatuh}). In all these cases, there is a syntactic reason for the second position clitic complex to fall on something other than the main predicate of the clause, and some of the clitics may appear multiply: within the second position complex (obligatorily) and on the main predicate (optionally). To my knowledge, the only clitics that ``spread" like this are \textit{=!aƛ} `now' (\ref{ex:doubleatluyi}, \ref{ex:doubleatlyuuqwaa}), \textit{=!at} \textsc{passive} (\ref{ex:doubleatuush}, \ref{ex:doubleatuh}), and \textit{=!ap} \textsc{causative} (\ref{ex:doubleap}). I will come back to how the multiple instances of the valence-altering clitics \textit{=!at} and \textit{=!ap} functions within serialization structures in \S\ref{sec:sv:valence}. %\footnote{There will be a significant discussion on multiple instances of the causative morpheme in \S\ref{sec:sv:valence}, which I treat differently. All instances of multiple causative morphemes appear to show the causative attaching to and modifying different predicates. This differs from \textit{=!aƛ} `now' and \textit{=!at} \textsc{passive}, where the morphemes are attaching to adpositions (\ref{ex:doubleatl}) or fronted quantifiers (\ref{ex:doubleatpass}).}

It is significant that in all the above examples, this syntactic doubling does not indicate any semantic doubling. In all of the examples, the unit that the second position enclitic attaches to is not notionally compatible with the semantics of ``now," or the application of a causative or passive.\footnote{The possible exception to this is (\ref{ex:doubleatluyi}), if \textit{ʔuyi} is understood as a full verb. As mentioned above, I believe it is an adposition.} That is, the examples here all show a strictly syntactic, not semantic, phenomenon.\footnote{This is not the case under serialization, where causative and passive morphology may affect only one verb under serialization. This will be addressed in \S\ref{sec:sv:valence}.} This syntactic ``doubling" is restricted to the clause in which the semantics of the morpheme apply. This can be seen in (\ref{ex:decidetogo}, \ref{ex:*decidetogo}) below, where the \textit{=!aƛ} `now' morpheme cannot be introduced in the subordinate clause, where it would alter the semantics in a bizarre or unintelligible way.

\section{Second position verbal suffixes} \label{sec:clause:2pv}

Another set of second position elements are verbal suffixes. Nuuchahnulth has a series of suffixing elements that attach to the leftmost item in their object. Although it is outside the scope of this dissertation, there is good independent reason to believe that these elements are suffix-like in the traditional sense, rather than clitic-like. Briefly, they are more tightly phonologically integrated into their root than the clausal clitics (\S\ref{sec:clause:cliticnormal}), they can attach to bound roots (the clausal clitics may not), and they occasionally produce unpredictable semantics. I will here simply assume their status as lexical suffixes with second position properties, rather than phrasal clitics.

The second position suffixes have been the locus of a fair amount of recent linguistic research in Nuuchahnulth, notably \cite{waldie2004}, \cite{wojdak2005}, and \cite{woo2007b}. \cite{wojdak2005} gives a detailed account of these suffixes under the Minimalist program. \cite{wojdak2005} breaks these suffixes into two broad categories, affixal main predicates (in my terminology, verbs which take participant complements) and affixal auxiliary predicates (verbs which take a predicate complement). I think this split is partially correct (although I will add one more basic category), but disagree with her overall account in at least one important way that are not attributable to our difference in framework. \citeauthor{wojdak2005} claims that these suffixes are insensitive to the category they attach to (p.\ 52--54). I think this claim is too general. Her argument comes down to two main predicate suffixes, \textit{-ʕiƛ} `find' and \textit{-atuł} `dream of,' which can attach to verbs (p.\ 159). While this may be the case for these particular verbs, it is not the general case for suffix verbs, which for the most part either strictly take referential semantic arguments (the ``main predicates") or eventive semantic arguments (the ``auxiliary predicates"). For the small number of suffixes, like \textit{-ʕiƛ} `find' and \textit{-atuł} `dream of', that can take both eventive and referential arguments can either be analyzed as a supertype of the two more specific lexical categories, or as lexically ambiguous. In either case, these are the minority. I will address the attachment properties of both main predicate suffixes (\ref{sec:clause:2pv:mainpredicate}) and auxiliary predicate suffixes (\ref{sec:clause:2pv:auxiliary}) independently below.

%I believe the different classes of these suffixes each have different attachment properties. I will focus here on these distinctions, and not mention the scoping issues (especially with respect to the negator), which \citeauthor{wojdak2005} goes into in depth.

I break the second position suffixes broadly into three categories: (i) main predicate suffixes (\S\ref{sec:clause:2pv:mainpredicate}), which are transitive (and ditransitive) verbs that take referential complements; (ii) auxiliary predicate suffixes (\S\ref{sec:clause:2pv:auxiliary}), which modify predicates they subject control, and typically have modal or modal-like semantics, and (iii) location suffixes (\S\ref{sec:clause:2pv:loc}), which \cite{wojdak2005} treats as a subtype of the main predicate suffixes, but I believe have some special properties that differentiate them. Finally, I note some suffixes which do not appear to fall under any of the above categories (\S\ref{sec:clause:2pv:additional}). It is probable that this list is incomplete or in error in some parts, and there is further specialization within each of these categories. I am only intending here to give an overview of these categories, which will help illuminate later analyses.

\subsection{Main predicate suffixes} \label{sec:clause:2pv:mainpredicate}

The main predicate suffixes are semantic units that relate referents (not events) to one another. They can be either transitive or ditransitive. That is, their basic semantic type is:

\ex
\textsc{relation}(\textit{e}, \textit{x1}, \textit{x2}, (\textit{x3}))
\xe

This includes relations such as \textsc{have}, \textsc{take}, \textsc{find}, \textsc{gather/hunt}, \textsc{consume}, and so on (expressed with -\textit{naˑk}, \textit{-L.!iƛ}, \textit{-L.waƛ}, \textit{-R.!iiḥ}, and \textit{-iis} respectively). The only ditransitive in this group that I know of is the suffix \textit{-ayiˑ}, which expresses the relation \textsc{give}.

I will use the suffix verb \textit{-naˑk} `have' to illustrate the syntactic attachment properties of these suffixes. Each sentence in (\ref{ex:havesong}--\ref{ex:havetwolongsongs}) shows a longer direct object of `have': song, two songs, two long songs. The suffix verb always attaches to the first element in the object.

\ex \label{ex:havesong}
\begingl
\glpreamble nuuknaaks. //
\gla nuuk-naˑk=s //
\glb song-have=\textsc{strg.1sg} //
\glft `I have a song/songs.' (\textbf{N}, \textit{yuułnaak} Simon Lucas) //
\endgl
\xe

\ex~ \label{ex:havetwosongs}
\begingl
\glpreamble ʔaƛanaks nuuk. //
\gla ʔaƛa-naˑk=s nuuk //
\glb two-have=\textsc{strg.1sg} song //
\glft `I have two songs.' (\textbf{N}, \textit{yuułnaak} Simon Lucas) //
\endgl
\xe

\ex~ \label{ex:havetwolongsongs}
\begingl
\glpreamble ʔaƛanaks y̓aaq nuuk. //
\gla ʔaƛa-naˑk=s y̓aaq nuuk. //
\glb song-have=\textsc{strg.1sg} //
\glft `I have two long songs.' (\textbf{N}, \textit{yuułnaak} Simon Lucas) //
\endgl
\xe

Instead of attaching to a semantically contentful word, the suffix verb can attach to the empty root \textit{ʔu-}, which I gloss as \textsc{x}. In this construction, the object can either appear after (\ref{ex:havechant}) or be dropped (\ref{ex:haveit}). Syntactically, the second position effect persists, if the \textit{ʔu-} root is seen as syntactically part of the object, but carrying no semantic content.

\ex \label{ex:havechant}
\begingl
\glpreamble ʔunaaks c̓iiqy̓ak. //
\gla ʔu-naˑk=s c̓iiq-y̓ak //
\glb \textsc{x}-have=\textsc{strg.1sg} chant-for //
\glft `I have a chant.' (\textbf{N}, \textit{yuułnaak} Simon Lucas) //
\endgl
\xe

\ex~ \label{ex:haveit}
\begingl
\glpreamble ʔiiqḥiis ʔunaˑk. //
\gla ʔiiqḥii=s ʔu-naak //
\glb still=\textsc{strg.1sg} \textsc{x}-have //
\glft `I still have it.' (\textbf{N}, Fidelia Haiyupis) //
\endgl
\xe

It is also possible for these elements to attach to an adverb. In this case, the adverb is always modifying the verb's event, as in (\ref{ex:longtimedog}).

\ex \label{ex:longtimedog}
\begingl
\glpreamble qiinaakitaḥ ʕiniiƛ. //
\gla qii-naˑk=(m)it=(m)aˑḥ ʕiniiƛ //
\glb long.time-have=\textsc{pst}=\textsc{real.1sg} dog //
\glft `I have had a dog for a long time.' (\textbf{B}, Bob Mundy) //
\endgl
\xe

This second position only scopes over the VP, and is separate from the clausal second position (\S\ref{sec:clause:cliticnormal}). As seen already in (\ref{ex:haveit}) and (\ref{ex:badnews}), the clausal second position occurs separately from the second position of the suffix verb. I give two more examples of this clear separation in with a negator (\ref{ex:badnews}) and a conjunction (\ref{ex:mightnotgive}) below.

\endgl
\xe

These suffixes typically cannot attach to verbs, as seen below. This makes sense if their semantics expect a referent and not event. With nouns and adjectives, syntactic incorporation incorporates a referent (either that of the noun or of the adjective's modifyee). With verbs, there is no clear referent to compose with.

[[TODO: Examples from Julia, MT]]

Despite this general rule, some suffixes in this class idiosyncratically attach to verbal roots with unpredictable semantics. For instance, the suffix \textit{-L.!iƛ} `take' can idiosyncratically attach to the verb root \textit{n̓ikʷ-} `claw' to yield \textit{n̓iik̓ʷiƛ} `take by clawing.' This does not describe two actions: a clawing event, and then taking the result of that event or a participant, but one event of seizing in talons or claws. This instrumentative reading is completely unpredictable. Another example is the suffix \textit{-uʔał} `see', which I have most commonly encountered attaching to the verb root \textit{n̓ač-} to form \textit{n̓ačuʔał} `see (esp.\ a person).'\footnote{Though less common, is possible for \textit{-uʔał} to attach in the ``normal" way of a suffix verb as well, as in (\ref{ex:sawabigman}).

\ex \label{ex:sawabigman}
\begingl
\glpreamble ʔiiḥuʔałitaḥ quuʔas ʔukłaa Adam. //
\gla ʔiiḥ-uʔał=(m)it=(m)aˑḥ quuʔas ʔu-(k)łaˑ Adam //
\glb big-see=\textsc{pst}=\textsc{real.1sg} person \textsc{x}-call Adam //
\glft `I saw a big person named Adam.' (\textbf{B}, Marjorie Touchie) //
\endgl
\xe
} This lexical doubling `see-see' is again unpredictable. I treat all these cases of verb attachment as unanalyzable, single lexical items.

It also seems to be the case that verbal attachment was either a more productive property or more widespread in the lexicon in the past, and I believe this is what \cite{wojdak2005} picks up on in her dissertation. Verbal attachment does happen, I am merely claiming that it has special properties. [[TODO: pick up here]]

NT:

ciqnaak̓aƛ ʔaḥʔaa y̓uuqʷaa huuʕiiʔatḥ.

This class of suffixes also attaches to root forms, when available. This can be seen in words like \textit{quuʔac-iic} `belonging to a Native person,' where the bound root form \textit{quuʔac} `person' is used instead of the free form \textit{quuʔas}. This also occurs with \textit{łuč-naak} `have a wife,' where the bound root form \textit{łuč} `woman' is used instead of the free form \textit{łuucsma}. If a word does not have a special bound form, the free form is used.

The first class of second position suffixes, then, are transitive and ditransitive verbs that take referential arguments. They attach to the first element of their complement, either the noun itself or a modifying adjective, or they may attach to the semantically empty root \textit{ʔu-} and take complements in the normal manner. They may also attach to an adverb, in which case the adverb modifies the semantics of the suffix verb itself. They do not generally attach to verbs, and when they do it is both syntactically and semantically unpredictable.

\subsection{Auxiliary predicate suffixes} \label{sec:clause:2pv:auxiliary}

The second class is auxiliary predicate suffixes. These tend to have modal or modal-like semantics, and relate a referent to an even. That is, the basic semantics are as below.

\ex
\textsc{relation}(\textit{e}, \textit{x1}, \textit{e2})
\xe

They are also all subject control verbs \citep[p.\ 160]{wojdak2005}: Their subject must match the subject of their complement predicate. Syntactically, this means that the \textit{x1} of the relation above is always identified with the subject of whatever the \textit{e2} is.

Syntactically, these suffixes behave in some similar ways to the transitive verb suffixes. As I used \textit{-naˑk} to exemplify the transitive verb suffixes, I will use \textit{-maḥsa} `want to do' to exemplify this category of suffix. The most straightforward use of this suffix is to attach to a verbal predicate, as in (\ref{ex:wanttograb}). As a suffix subject control verb, the subject of the wanting event in (\ref{ex:wanttograb}) is the same as the subject of the grabbing event.

\ex \label{ex:wanttograb}
\begingl
\glpreamble hišuk̓aƛ čaakupiiḥ sukʷiƛmaḥsa ḥaa p̓aacac̓umʔi //
\gla hišuk=!aƛ čaakupiiḥ su-kʷiƛ-maḥsa ḥaa p̓aacac̓um=ʔiˑ //
\glb all=\textsc{now} man.\textsc{pl} hold-\textsc{mo}-want.to.do \textsc{ddyn} football\footnotemark=\textsc{art} //
\glft `All the men want to get that \textit{p̓aacsac̓um}.' (\textbf{C}, \textit{tupaat} Julia Lucas) //
\endgl
\xe

\footnotetext{A \textit{p̓aacac̓um} is not quite a football. It is a ball that is used in a certain kind of \textit{tupaati} competition. The object is to lift it above the head.}

%n̓aacsiičiƛmaḥsas. JL

Like with the suffixing transitive verbs, this class of suffixes can also attach to a preceding modifier of its argument. Since the normal argument of the auxiliary predicate suffixes is a verb, this means they can attach to a modifying adverb, as in (\ref{ex:onlywanttosay}).

\ex \label{ex:onlywanttosay}
\begingl
\glpreamble ʔaanimaḥsas waa ʔin čamiḥtaʔaƛni ʔiiḥʔiiḥa ʔuḥʔaƛquu ḥaw̓iiḥ qʷaaʔap. //

\glft `I only want to say that it was really important what the chiefs did.' (\textbf{N}, \textit{yuułnaak} Simon Lucas) //
\endgl
\xe

It is much less common, but these suffixes can attach to adjectives and nouns. I only have one example of \textit{-maḥsa} attaching to an adjective in my corpus (\ref{ex:wanttomakestrong}), but I found an example of nominal attachment in the Nootka Texts (\ref{ex:wanttobechief}). In both of these cases, the non-verbal element is being treated predicatively: `be strong' in (\ref{ex:wanttomakestrong}) and not `a strong (something)', and `be a chief (i.e.\ wealthy)' in (\ref{ex:wanttobechief}), and not `a chief.' I take this as corroborating evidence of the inherent eventiveness of adjectives and nouns (\S\ref{sec:clause:predp}).

\glft `It was because of this that I wanted to be wealthy (= a chief).' (\textbf{B}, Tom saayaač̓apis, \cite[p.25]{sapir1955}) //
\endgl
\xe

Unlike the transitive verb suffixes, these suffixes attach to the empty root \textit{ʔu-} only idiosyncratically, and may have a default interpretation. The suffix \textit{-maḥsa} happens to be one that does attach to \textit{ʔu-}. In the absence of an object, \textit{ʔumaḥsa} has the interpretation of wanting someone sexually.

\ex \label{ex:wanttomarry}
\begingl
\glpreamble ʔiiqḥuk̓aƛ hišuk maʔas ʔin ʔumaḥsiičiƛ. //

\glft `He told the whole village that he wanted her (as his wife).' (\textbf{C}, \textit{tupaat} Julia Lucas) //
\endgl
\xe

Other suffixes I put in this category, however, cannot take the \textit{ʔu-} root, despite otherwise behaving in a similar manner to \textit{-maḥsa}. This includes \textit{-w̓it̓as} `going to do', \textit{-L.sinḥi} `try to do', and \textit{-qaˑtḥ} `claim.' I treat the \textit{ʔu-} attachment of these event-taking suffixes as idiosyncratic.

Auxiliary predicate suffix verbs modify a complement that is an event. Typically this means a verb (\ref{ex:wanttograb}), but they can modify the event properties of an adjective or noun as well (\ref{ex:wanttomakestrong}, \ref{ex:wanttobechief}). These suffixes exhibit the same second position properties of the main predicate suffix verbs, and may attach to an adverb modifying a later predicate complement (\ref{ex:onlywanttosay}). They only idiosyncratically attach to the root form \textit{ʔu-}.

\subsection{Location suffixes} \label{sec:clause:2pv:loc}

The third category in my typology is location suffixes, which relate a figure to a ground. These are suffixes like \textit{-c̓uˑ} `inside a container' and \textit{-!as} `outside.' These suffixes freely attach to both nouns and verbs, and for both they modify the location, either the location of the noun (e.g., \textit{ʔink} `a fire' and \textit{ʔink̓ʷas} `a fire outside') or the location of the verb (e.g., \textit{pisat-} `play' and \textit{pisat̓as} `play outside'). It is possible that these may be simple event modification, and collapsible under my definition of auxiliary predicate suffixes. However, locative suffixes also tend to attach the the empty root \textit{hita-} or \textit{hina-}, instead of \textit{ʔu-}, as in \textit{hitaas} `outside'. However these suffixes may sometimes attach to \textit{ʔu-} as well, as in \textit{ʔuc̓uu} `inside.' I do not have an analysis for this, and leave description of the locative suffixes for future work. I have not analyzed these suffixes in my implemented grammar.

\subsection{A possible fourth category} \label{sec:clause:2pv:additional}

With the possible exception of the location suffixes (\S\ref{sec:clause:2pv:loc}, all these categories so far are eventive. The main predicate suffixes relate two referents, but are themselves events that can be modified by an adverb, and behave as a predicate in the syntax (\S\ref{sec:clause:2pv:mainpredicate}). The auxiliary predicate suffixes relate a referent and an event, but again are events in their semantics\footnote{The argument for this is a little bit theory-dependent, but the auxiliary predicate suffixes may be the topmost predicate in a clause, and on the assumption that sentences are propositions, thus need to be events that can be evaluated.} and syntactic predicates (\S\ref{sec:clause:2pv:auxiliary}).

There appear to be a few suffixes that are treated as non-predicative in the syntax, and are participants in the syntax, or ambiguously so, as with nouns. This category, if it exists, may only consist of \textit{-y̓ak/č̓ak} `for, used for' and \textit{-ʕaƛ} `the sound of.' These endings can be placed on verbal suffixes, such as \textit{pisat-} `play' to form a noun, \textit{pisaty̓ak} `manner of play', or complex roots to form a more complex noun, as in \textit{pikčas-c̓u} `pictures-inside' to form \textit{pikčasc̓uy̓ak} `television.' However they can also be used with the empty root \textit{ʔu-}, as in the following sentence, taken from a recording of the late Barbara Touchie by Henry Kammler:

\ex \label{ex:uyak}
\begingl
\glpreamble ʔaanačiłsamaḥ ḥamat̓ap hiłukʷitii mamaḥt̓i ʔuy̓ak mamuʔasm̓inḥʔi, shacks ʔukłaamit. //

\glft `The only thing I remember is they would go to the houses used for working outside, called shacks.' (\textbf{B}, Barbara Touchie) //
\endgl
\xe

As with the locatives, I do not have an analysis for this suffix, or know if there are others in this category.

\subsection{Note on adpositions} \label{sec:clause:2pv:adp}

I will make an argument later on that some of the nominal-taking transitive verb suffixes are best modeled as adpositions (\S\ref{sec:link:adpositive}). Most importantly, this will include the object-marking \textit{-L.(č)ił}, which \cite{woo2007b} analyzes as \textit{v} within the Minimalist Program. The reason I use the term `adposition' rather than \textit{v} is largely theory-internal: There is no such category as \textit{v} within HPSG, and I need to account for the grammatical phenomenon somehow. We are describing the same data, and I don't think this difference in framework makes any difference in empirical claims. Anticipating the need for prepositional suffixes, I will simply note that the way I treat \textit{-L.(č)ił} will not differ greatly from how I treat ordinary noun-taking transitive verbs (\S\ref{sec:clause:2pv:mainpredicate}) except that the type of the phrase will be defined as an \textit{adposition} rather than \textit{verb}.

\section{Verbal aspect} \label{sec:clause:aspect}

Finally, I will need to sketch the aspectual system of Nuuchahnulth and my understanding of it. \cite[240--241]{sapir1939} analyze the aspect system as containing twelve aspect forms. I will list them along with the examples given based on the verbal root \textit{mitxʷ-} `turn,' translated into the modern orthography.

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
\item Durative \textit{mitxʷaa}
\item Inceptive \textit{mitxʷiičiƛ}
\item Graduated Inceptive \textit{miitxʷičiƛ}
\item Pre-inceptive \textit{miitxʷičiƛšiƛ}
\item Inceptive iterative\footnote{This form is rare in the modern language and complex. I will not give it much attention, but it is discussed in detail as the ``Iterative II" in \cite[242--244]{davidson2002}, where he claims that it is not inceptive but merely a formal alternate to the typical iterative.} \textit{miitxmiitxʷičiił}
\item Repetitive \textit{miitxmiitxʷa}
\item Repetitive inceptive \textit{miitxmiitxšiƛ}
\item Momentaneous \textit{mitxšiƛ}
\item Graduative \textit{miitxšiƛ}
\item Pre-graduative \textit{miitxšiƛšiƛ}
\item Iterative \textit{mitxmitxš}
\item Iterative inceptive \textit{mitxmitxššiƛ}
\end{enumerate}

Several of these aspects are composites. The only unitary aspects in this list are: durative, inceptive, repetitive, momentaneous, and iterative. The graduative (a long-short template, or LS) may be applied to inceptive and momentaneous forms, and the momentaneous may apply to any of the forms that do not terminate with a momentaneous or inceptive aspect.

In her dissertation, \citealt{rose1981} (263--269) splits \citeauthor{sapir1939}'s durative category into two: a durative aspect (marked with -ak or -uk) and a continuative aspect (marked with a -(y)aˑ). This distinction was continued in both \citealt{nakayama2001} (26--27) and \citealt{davidson2002} (232--237). \citeauthor{davidson2002} describes the durative as expressing `intransitive imperfective state' or `imperfective process,' and follows \citeauthor{rose1981} in saying the continuative expresses a dynamic situation, in the sense that energy input is necessary to continue the action. At least in \citeauthor{davidson2002}'s version, the continuative can go on to take the inceptive (p.\ 246) and although he does not give it in the aspect chart, the durative can go on to take the perfective (p.\ 155).

Taking this baseline, the number of total possible aspects increases to 14, and a flow chart of aspect forms looks like (\ref{aspect-traditional}) below. The nodes in the graph are fully inflected aspectual forms (save for the leftmost starting node, which is an aspectless root), and the lines show the basic allomorph that is added to the stem to create the aspect form. Not every root takes every form, but if one basic aspect form is possible (e.g., the repetitive) then the forms after it are possible (e.g., the repetitive momentaneous). I have regularized the naming conventions somewhat from \citeauthor{sapir1939}, and so in the graph give next to each aspect form a number affiliating it with their list. Number 13 is for the continuative aspect and 14 is for the durative-momentaneous. A box is drawn around perfective forms.

\end{comment}

In this schema, the continuative and inceptive are unusual aspect types. The inceptive can either go on the bare root or the continuative (but not other aspects), and the continuative is the only basic imperfective aspect form that cannot take the momentaneous \textit{-šiƛ} or the graduative. Adam Werle has convinced me (\textit{p.c.}) that the ``inceptive" is in fact the same as the momentaneous, and that the \textit{-iˑčiƛ} form is simply the form that the momentaneous takes under certain morphophonological conditions, namely: (1) after the continuative; (2) on monosyllabic roots that have a coda.

In the limited tests I did with consultants, this appeared to be correct. There are a small number of verb roots that can take both an inceptive and a momentaneous-graduative (but not, incidentally, a bare momentaneous) aspect. In the cases I tested, speakers were convinced that the momentaneous-graduative and inceptive forms had exactly the same meaning. One example is the root \textit{muł-} which refers to the tide coming up. The continuative \textit{mułaa} means `tide coming up' while speakers tend to translate \textit{muułšiƛ} as `tide is coming in,' while insisting this is different from \textit{mułaa}. \textit{muułšiƛ} looks like a momentaneous-graduative (with a lengthened first vowel), but speakers said there was not a word \textit{*mułšiƛ}, which would be the bare perfective.\footnote{There exists a fairly large number of verb forms that have what looks like a graduative template (LS) but do not seem to have any graduative meaning, and the template cannot be removed. As far as I know this only happens with momentaneous (or perfective, as I will end up calling it) forms and durative forms. \textit{muułšiƛ} `tide coming in' belongs to the group of perfective forms that include a LS template, but is joined by \textit{yaacšiƛ} `walk' from the root \textit{yac-} `walk', and \textit{tuupšiƛ} `become dark' from \textit{tupk-} `black.' The durative forms with an LS template include the \textit{yaacuk} `walking' also from the root \textit{yac-} `walk,' \textit{šiiƛuk} `move house' from \textit{šiƛ} `move,' and \textit{ƛiiḥak} `paddling' from \textit{ƛiḥ} `paddle.' In my implementation, I simply treat these as irregular verb forms, but more work needs to be done to understand why this lengthening template applies to these particular roots.} I asked if there existed a word \textit{mułiičiƛ} and both speakers I asked (Fidelia Haiyupis, northern dialect, and Bob Mundy, Barkley sound dialect) said yes, and insisted it had the exact same meaning as \textit{muułšiƛ}. This follows from Werle's understanding of the \textit{-iˑčiƛ} form as the momentaneous applying after a continuative.

There is also the fact that there are certain monosyllabic, closed syllable roots which always take the \textit{-iˑčiƛ} and never \textit{-šiƛ}. These forms are idiosyncratic and have to be learned. For instance, the perfective form of the negator \textit{wik} is \textit{wikiičiƛ} and never \textit{*wikšiƛ}. Likewise the adjective \textit{ƛ̓ac} `fat' becomes \textit{ƛ̓aciičiƛ} `become fat' and not \textit{*ƛ̓acšiƛ}, \textit{ƛaw} `be near' becomes \textit{ƛawiičiƛ} `come near' and not \textit{*ƛawčiƛ}, and \textit{ʔuḥ} `be' becomes \textit{ʔuḥiičiƛ} `become', not \textit{*ʔuḥšiƛ}. Leaving aside the question of whether this has always been the case, I assume Werle's basic analysis of the `inceptive': That is, it is not a unique aspect form but a morphophonologically conditioned alternate of the so-called momentaneous. This collapse makes the aspect system of Nuuchahnulth look a little more typical of languages around the world. There is a perfective aspect, marked with a large number of allophones but namely \textit{-šiƛ} and \textit{-iˑčiƛ}, and then a variety of imperfective aspects (repetitive, iterative, durative, continuative, and graduative). Verb stems that are perfective may take the graduative (once) to become imperfective, and imperfective verb stems may take the perfective \textit{-šiƛ}. The simplified flow chart is in (\ref{aspect-mine}) below.

%In serial verb constructions (SVCs), some of these same clitics---especially the causative---may apply separately to different verbs in the SVC. This will be addressed in more depth in \S\ref{sec:sv:valence}.

%\section{Clitics attaching to modifiers} \label{sec:clause:cliticmodifier}

%\noindent (TODO: Actually implement this and give a summary of the lexical rule type. There's going to be some complications with list modifications and quantification.)

In my glosses, I will indicate the perfective with the abbreviation \textsc{pf}, continuative with \textsc{ct}, durative with \textsc{dr}, repetitive with \textsc{rp}, iterative with \textsc{it}, and graduative with \textsc{gr}.

\section{HPSG Analysis and Implementation} \label{sec:clause:analysis}

I will now go over how I have modeled the above syntactic facts about clauses in my HPSG implemented grammar. Though the framework is particular, much of this analysis should be intelligible to people working in other frameworks. For those more familiar with other syntactic formalisms, I will attempt to give some basic guidance to decoding the formalism.

In HPSG, each node in a tree (including words) is composed of a large attribute-value matrix defining the properties of the node. Attributes are things like \textsc{head} and a value may be something like \textit{noun}. This is written as [\textsc{head} \textit{noun}]. Values can be a simple atomic symbol or they can be another attribute-value matrix. For instance, \textit{noun}, which is a possible value for \textsc{head}, is itself a matrix with further information inside it, such as [\textsc{form} \textit{finite}]. HPSG is dedicated to fidelity to the surface string order, and there is no movement. Long-distance dependency is done instead through valence lists present at each node in the tree. The two most common of these lists are \textsc{subj} (subject) and \textsc{comps} (complements). As the tree is constructed, information is added to (or more precisely, unified with) \textsc{subj} and \textsc{comps} values, which is how valence information is preserved. Long-distance dependencies which in other theories are modeled through movement are here modeled by moving a valence item from the \textsc{subj} or \textsc{comps} list into a \textsc{slash} list, which propagates up the tree until the extracted element is found.

In addition to the matrices present at each point in the tree, the phrase structure rules (PSRs) have to be defined for each possible ordering. So there may be a \textit{head-complement-rule} which defines how a head node combines with a non-head node to its right. This is analogous to \textit{merge} in Minimalism, although in HPSG the rules about which merges are allowed are specified within each PSR. For instance, a PSR may specify that one of its daughters has to have a certain property: for instance, when discharging a long-distance dependency, the head daughter should have something on its \textsc{slash} list, and the non-head daughter needs to have properties consistent with what the head daughter says about the item on its \textsc{slash}. This unification is indicated through reentrencies (boxes with the same label) which specify that two items in the attribute-value matrix are the same.

Or a PSR might say that its head daughter needs to be [\textsc{head.aux} +]. In this case, that rule cannot operate on a node that is defined as [\textsc{head.aux} --]. However, we allow for values to be underspecified. A node may not know if it is an auxiliary or not, in which case it is simply [\textsc{head.aux} \textit{bool}], our way of denoting underspecification. A node of this type can unify with PSRs that require [\textsc{aux} +] and [\textsc{aux} --]. However, once it goes through that kind of rule, its \textsc{aux} value is set. This is how the framework allows words and even phrases to be used in different ways in different tree structures. Complex forms of type hierarchies are important to unification in HPSG. While the type \textit{bool} only has two subtypes, + and --, the types available to \textit{aspect} may be far more complex, which then allows for more complex types of unification.

My grammar is built on top of analyses present in the Grammar Matrix \citep{bender2002}, and where possible I reuse distinctions and analyses present there. In particular, I use some of the features defined in the Grammar Matrix (like \textsc{prd}, \textsc{aux}), and inherit from generic phrase structure types like \textit{decl-head-subj-phrase} and \textit{basic-unary-phrase}. I will not expect familiarity with all these pre-defined types, and will attempt to give all the relevant components of the rules and type definitions. However, most definitions given here are subsets of full definitions given in my implemented grammar, which can be found at [[TODO: bitbucket repo link]]. I will not go over every analysis here, but only those I believe are the most significant for later discussion: the predicate and participant distinction (\ref{sec:clause:analysis:predpart}), the second position clausal elements (\ref{sec:clause:analysis:2p}), the second position verbal suffixes (\ref{sec:clause:analysis:2pv}), and verbal aspect (\ref{sec:clause:analysis:aspect}).

\subsection{Predicates and participants} \label{sec:clause:analysis:predpart}

As argued in \S\ref{sec:clause:predp}, nouns, adjectives, and verbs are all events, and yet when used as participants, the grammar needs to distinguish nouns from adjectives and verbs (\S\ref{sec:clause:partp}). I use the value \textsc{prd} (predicative) on the \textsc{head} feature to model the predicate/participant distinction in Nuuchahnulth. I have a supertype, \textit{predicate-lex}, which states that its \textsc{head.prd} value is +. All the lexical types that are predicative---verbs, and adjectives, and common nouns---inherit from this supertype. So every lexical entry for a verb, adjective, or common noun inherits the property [\textsc{head.prd} +], and can be treated as a predicate where the grammar demands it.

Participants are simply defined as [\textsc{head.prd} --]. A word can be defined as [\textsc{head.prd} --] by its lexical inheritance (e.g., proper nouns are defined as non-predicative), or through the application of a rule. As detailed in \S\ref{sec:clause:partp}, all dependent clauses headed by the enclitic \textit{=ʔiˑ} are participants. I will address the analysis for this in \S\ref{sec:clause:analysis:2p}. However, common nouns also need to be treated as participants as well as predicates. I achieve this through a lexical rule (that is, something that must apply prior to syntactic rules) that alters the semantics of the noun. Recall that as predicates, common nouns have an event variable and a subject. Parts of my type definition for a common noun are given in (\ref{ex:commonnounlex}).

\ex \label{ex:commonnounlex}
\begin{avm}
\[ \asort{common-noun-lex}
   synsem.local & \[ cat & \[ head.prd & +\\
                         val & \[ subj & \< \avmbox{1} \> \\
                           comps & \< \> \] \] \\
                   cont.hook \[ index & \avmbox{3} \\
                                xarg & \avmbox{2} \] \] \\
   arg-st & \< \avmbox{1} \[ local.cont.index & \avmbox{2} \[ person & 3rd \] \] \> \\
   rels & \< \[ pred & \textit{pred} \\
                arg0 & \[ \avmbox{3} \textit{event} \] \\
                arg1 & \[ \avmbox{2} \textit{referent} \] \] \> \]
\end{avm}
\xe

This rule can most easily be read bottom-to-top. It states that common nouns are semantically a relation between two arguments: an event, and a referential index.\footnote{Note the underspecified \textsc{pred} value. Not to be confused with my use of ``syntactic predicate," the \textsc{pred}(ication) value in the DELPH-IN HPSG implementation is the name of the relation. So the Nuuchahnulth word \textit{ʕiniiƛ} `dog' has the meaning \textsc{ʕiniiƛ}, or for legibility in my grammar, \textsc{dog\_n}.} The referent argument is identified with the \textsc{index} attribute of the only thing in the noun's syntactic \textsc{arg(ument)-st(ructure)}. \textsc{arg-st} is used in HPSG as a translation layer between the semantics (the \textsc{rels} list) and the syntax (in the \textsc{synsem} layer above). All items on a word's \textsc{arg-st} must correspond to items in its valence lists (most notably, \textsc{subj(ect)} and \textsc{comp(lement)s}). The lone item in the noun's \textsc{arg-st} is identified with its subject, and it has no complements. The semantic argument that is the available in the compositional syntax, at the path \textsc{synsem.local.cont.hook.index}, is that of the event variable in the relation, and so the noun is treated as eventive. The variable to the referent is kept on the \textsc{xarg}, a sort of semantic scratch value that is typically used for subjects. (I will return to the \textsc{xarg} later.) Finally, the \textsc{head.prd} attribute is set to +, indicating that common nouns, and all trees headed by a common noun, are predicative.

The above \textit{\textsc{common-noun-lex}} type functions when nouns are acting as predicates. To treat nouns as participants, they must go through a lexical rule first. The major parts of the lexical rule are in (\ref{ex:nounrelativizerlexrule}).

\ex \label{ex:nounrelativizerlexrule}
\begin{avm}
\[\asort{noun-relativizer-lex-rule}
synsem.local & \[ cat.head & \[\asort{noun}
                                 prd & - \] \\
                    val & \[ subj & \< \> \\
                             comps & \< \> \] \\
                    cont.hook.index & \avmbox{1} \] \\
  dtr & \[ synsem.local & \[ cat.head & \[\asort{noun}
                                           prd & + \] \\
                             cont.hook.xarg & \avmbox{1} \] \] \]
\end{avm}
\xe

This rule takes a daughter that is headed by a noun. It creates a new lexical item that has no subject or complements, and is not predicative, making it a participant. It moves the noun's \textsc{xarg} value into its \textsc{index}, so that in the compositional semantics, it is being treated a referent and not an event.

\subsection{Second position inflection} \label{sec:clause:analysis:2p}

As detailed in \S\ref{sec:clause:cliticnormal}, Nuuchahnulth clauses are headed by their second-position inflection. I define the second position elements as selecting for a complement that is [\textsc{head.pred} +]. I call this complex of a second position element and its predicate a \textit{predicate phrase} (abbreviated PredP). By design, within a PredP there is no differentiation between `verb,' `adjective,' and `noun,' as the distinction is irrelevant in this context. 

Second position elements take a predicate to their left and inherit all their predicate's syntactic participants. The basic type definition for a second position clitic is given in (\ref{ex:2p-lex-item}).

\ex \label{ex:2p-lex-item}
\adjustbox{max width=\textwidth - 0.4in}{
\begin{avm}
\[\asort{2p-lex-item}
synsem.local.cat & \[ head.mod & \< \> \\
                    val & \[ subj & \< \avmbox{1} \[ local.cat.head.prd & -- \] \> \\
      comps & \< \[ opt & -- \\
                  local.cat & \[ head.prd & + \\
                               val & \[ subj & \< \avmbox{1} \> \\
                                        comps & \avmbox{2} \] \] \] \> $\oplus$ \avmbox{2} \] \] \]
\end{avm}
}
\xe

This lexical definition states that second position clitics are non-modifying words which have both a subject and a complements list. Its first complement is a non-optional predicate, which has a subject and some number of complements (possibly zero). Its first complement's subject is identified as its own subject, and its first complement's complements list is appended to its own complements. So if this lexical item finds an intransitive predicate complement, it becomes a transitive item: Its subject is its complement's subject, and its only complement is the intransitive predicate it picked up. If this lexical item finds a transitive predicate, it becomes ditransitive. Once again, it will have a subject identified with that transitive predicate, and then its complements list will include two items: first the transitive predicate itself, and then the transitive predicate's own complement. And so on.

As indicated in \S\ref{sec:clause:cliticnormal}, there are two major types of clausal second position lexemes: the auxiliary predicate head, and the article. The predicative versions are part of the mood complex, and belong to the type \textsc{\textit{mood-2p-verb-lex}} (\ref{ex:mood-2p-verb-lex}), which inherits from (is a subtype of) \textsc{\textit{2p-lex-item}} above. This rule needs to state that this lexical item makes a predicate and inherits its complement's semantic event. Then the lexical entry for each morpheme further specifies the clitic's particular properties: the mood of the complement, and the person and number properties of the subject.

\ex \label{ex:mood-2p-verb-lex}
\begin{avm}
\[\asort{mood-2p-verb-lex}
synsem.local & \[ cat & \[ head.prd & + \\
                           val.comps$\ldots$index & \avmbox{1} \] \\
                  cont.hook.index & \avmbox{1} \] \]
\end{avm}
\xe

The article lexeme also inherits from \textsc{\textit{2p-lex-item}}, but adds different constraints (\ref{ex:article-lex}). The article needs to state that it creates a participant (that is, a non-predicate), that it is picking up its complement's subject's semantics (that is, the referent and not the event), and that that referent is in the third person.

\ex \label{ex:article-lex}
\begin{avm}
\[\asort{article-lex}
synsem.local & \[ cat & \[ head.prd & -- \\
                      val.comps$\ldots$subject$\ldots$index & \avmbox{1}  \] \\
                cont.hook.index & \avmbox{1} \[ png.per & 3rd \] \] \]
\end{avm}
\xe

The above definitions for second position elements license trees that have simple second position elements. I will give sample trees for the three types of predicates introduced in \S\ref{sec:clause:predp}: verbs (\ref{ex:verbpred}), adjectives (\ref{ex:adjpred}), and nouns (\ref{ex:nounpred}). Trees for each of the sentences are given in (\ref{ex:verbpredtree}), (\ref{ex:adjpredtree}), and (\ref{ex:nounpredtree}) respectively. The attribute-value matrices have been somewhat simplified to fit on the page, and identifying semantic features (through \textsc{hook.index} and \textsc{hook.xarg}) have been elided. Identification of semantic features is shown simply by identifying a slot (e.g., the \textit{x} the relation \textsc{see}(\textit{x}, \textit{y})) with an entire feature structure. In the implemented grammar, this is done through the identification of values with the \textsc{hook} features. Finally, there are some phrase structure rules that have not yet been introduced. They are present to complete the trees. The main points I am illustrating are second position argument composition and the predicate-participant distinction, which is created by the \textsc{head.prd} value at each level of the tree. %\footnote{Note that here I have used the symbol \textsc{rel} to refer to what I have defined as a semantic \textit{relation}. In the implemented grammar, this is labeled \textsc{pred} for `predicate symbol'. This does not cause a problem with the \textsc{pred} value on \textsc{head}, because the two attributes lie on different paths.} Participant phrases (PartP) appear in these trees, but will be addressed in \S\ref{sec:clause:partp}.

%Syntactic predicates are modeled by placing a \textsc{pred} value within the \textsc{head} features of parts of speech. Any part of speech that is [\textsc{pred} +] may behave as a predicate. The predicate phrase in Nuuchahnulth is analogous to a verb phrase in English. Just as a clause in English HPSG analyses is defined as a VP that has empty \textsc{subj} and \textsc{comp} lists, a clause in Nuuchahnulth is a PredP that has empty \textsc{subj} and \textsc{comp} lists. A significant difference between predicates and a PredP in Nuuchahnulth and verbs and a VP in English is that, because of the second position clitics, the PredP is headed by inflectional material while the predicate is its first complement. This is unlike English VPs, where the verbal element is itself the head of the clause. The nature of this second position will be discussed in more detail in \S\ref{sec:clause:cliticnormal} and \S\ref{sec:clause:cliticmodifier}. With the nature of the syntactic predicate sketched out, I now turn to participant phrases (PartP).

%I model this by again making use of the \textsc{pred} feature. Like other second position inflection, I model the ``article" (relativizer) as requiring its complement to be [\textsc{pred} +], creating a structure that is [\textsc{pred} --]. Since verbs, nouns, and adjectives are all [\textsc{pred} +], they can all appear with the article attached. I model proper nouns as [\textsc{pred} --], so that they cannot be taken as a complement of the article. I define participants (as opposed to predicates) as necessarily [\textsc{pred} --], which allows article-headed clauses and proper nouns to occur as participants.

%The trees (\ref{ex:verbparttree}, \ref{ex:adjparttree}) sketch my syntactic analysis of the verbal and adjectival participants in (\ref{ex:verbpart}, \ref{ex:adjpart}). In (\ref{ex:adjparttree}) a PartP is serving as a complement of the predicate through a head-complement rule (\citealt{bender2002, pollardsag1994}) while in (\ref{ex:verbparttree}), the PartP is filling a subject role through a head-subject rule (\textit{ibid}). Importantly, both of these rules are selecting for a non-head-daughter that is [\textsc{pred} --]. This guarantees that either the article will appear on the participant, or the participant will be of a category that is non-predicative.

In the interest of space I am omitting from this chapter trees showing a verbal participant (\ref{ex:verbparttree}) and an adjectival participant (\ref{ex:adjparttree}). However, the relevant example trees are in Appendix \ref{sec:appendix:trees}. These trees simply show that the article accepts any predicative category as its complement.

%It is worth pointing out to the reader that the main distinction\footnote{I am, for the moment, glossing over the semantics of relativization. The details of this, which are not the purpose of this dissertation, can be found in the implemented grammar} between article \textit{=ʔiˑ} and other second-position inflection is that the \textit{=ʔiˑ} creates a [\textsc{pred} --] parent while other inflection creates a [\textsc{pred} +] parent. This binary distinction succinctly captures the distributional difference.

%There is one fact about participants not yet captured in this analysis, which is that common nouns may function both as predicates and participants. Using only the syntactic rules given so far, common nouns cannot be used as participants without an article present. I use a unary (non-branching) rule that relativizes nominal components. My initial model was to underspecify the \textsc{pred} value on common nouns, but this generates the wrong semantics. The semantic modeling I have used for nouns such as \textit{pisatuwił} `gym' looks like this:

%\ex~
%\textsc{gym}(\textit{e}, \textit{x})
%\xe

%The event variable \textit{e} is there for sentential tense, aspect, mood, and evidentiality values (TAME), as well as adverbial modification, as in (\ref{ex:nounpred}). However, it is the first argument (\textit{x}) that is needed by the semantics when nouns are used as participants. That is, on this model nouns need to be relativized the same way that adjectives and verbs need to be. The only distinction is that nouns may be relativized without the article \textit{=ʔiˑ} present. I create a unary lexical relativization rule that requires that its daughter node be a common noun.


%That is, common nouns are neither specified for [\textsc{pred} +] nor [\textsc{pred} --], so they may happily unify in a predicative position without an article (taking on a -- value) or with the predicative clitics, including the article (taking on a + value). This means that in sentences like (\ref{ex:verbpred}), the participant phrase \textit{hałmiiḥa quuʔas} `drowning person' is in fact an NP. Since it is [\textsc{head} noun], and noun is [\textsc{pred} ?], the NP happily unifies through the head-complement rule that is expecting a [\textsc{pred} --] complement. In the same way, NPs may be selected for by the article \textsc{=ʔiˑ}, and so the PartP \textit{ḥaakʷaaƛ=ʔiˑ} `the young woman' in (\ref{ex:adjpred}) may be built up in the same way as in (\ref{ex:verbparttree}, \ref{ex:adjparttree}) above. Common nouns are unique in this way.

\begin{comment}
[[TODO: revise below on fronting]]

The way I model this phenomenon is via a gap-filler construction \citep[Chapter 4]{pollardsag1994}, which avoids the problem of having to recalculate how the clitics behave in a sentence like (\ref{ex:focus}). A sketch of the tree is given below.

My analysis for this is the same as that for focus fronting, minus the addition of focused information. I create a similar rule that behaves in the same way, \textit{non-focus-filler-head-rule}. Where the \textit{focus-filler-head-rule} adds focus information to its non-head-daughter, the \textit{non-focus-filler-head-rule} does not, and requires that its non-head-daughter be [\textsc{head} \textit{quantifier}]. Similarly, I add the constraint to \textit{focus-filler-head-rule} that its non-head-daughter be [\textsc{head} \textit{non-quantifier}].

I assert that the clitics are the syntactic heads of the clause. This analysis requires argument composition, or a word (in this case, the syntactic word of the second position enclitic complex) taking on the arguments of its complement (here, the sentential predicate), an analysis first developed in \cite{millersag1997}. The way I model this in my implementation is by the subject-mood clitics taking their complement's valence properties and making it their own. That is, the generic type for the second-position clitics is:

\ex \label{ex:2pavm}
\begin{avm}
\[\asort{clausal-inflection}
  \textsc{head.pred} & + \\
  \textsc{subj} & \avmbox{1} \\
  \textsc{comp} & \< \[\textsc{head.pred} & $+$ \\
                       \textsc{subj} & \avmbox{1} \\
                       \textsc{comp} & \avmbox{2} \] \>\ $\oplus$ \avmbox{2}
 \]
\end{avm}
\xe

%TODO: Further flesh out the above with full rule extraction from the (not buggy) implementation.
\end{comment}

%The inflection unifies its complement's subject with its own, and adds its complement's complements list to its own complements list. Particular lexical items in the class of clausal inflection inherit from the rule type above and add their own semantic information (second person subject and hearsay evidentiality, for example).

This analysis---and the trees given so far---depends on viewing the second position enclitic complex as its own syntactic word. Since my implementation currently lacks a morphophonological component, I have whitespace-separated the second position enclitic complex. This also requires that only one of the enclitics inherit from (\ref{ex:2p-lex-item}): one of the enclitics must be the head of the syntactic word. Every enclitic is optional, with the exception of the subject-mood portmanteaus. Given this, I have modeled the subject-mood portmanteau as the root, with preceding enclitics attaching to the subject-mood portmanteau as ``prefixes," and following morphemes attaching as ``suffixes" that modify the appropriate syntactico-semantic properties.

This creates an analytical issue for the third person neutral mood, which is null-marked. Notionally, there is an invisible ``=0" in the string, but to avoid it being written in the output, I use some work-arounds in the DELPH-IN architecture. There are two cases where the null third person element is introduced: (1) when there are other enclitics (the habitual or causative, for example) but no subject-mood portmanteau; (2) when there are no enclitics at all, only the understood null third person neutral mood. My grammar handles the two cases differently.

In case 1, the string ``=0" is generated just like any other enclitic. I define a special inflectional flag \textsc{some-inflection} and set its value to -- just for the third person neutral. This means that a string consisting only of ``=0" is not fully inflected and not allowed to be a word. For all of the prefixes and suffixes, I allow them to overwrite the string ``=0" with themselves, and these inflectional rules set the \textsc{some-inflection} flag to +. This means that the first prefixing or suffixing element to be added to the enclitic makes it a fully inflected word, and removes the ``=0" from the output. So the string ``=ʔaała" (habitual) is underlyingly ``=0=ʔaała", and the subject and mood information is generated by the ``=0".

In case 2, there is no additional enclitic to overwrite the ``=0" string, so this approach does not work. In this case, I create a lexical rule which takes any fully-inflected predicative word and creates a second position auxiliary out of it with the information of the third person neutral mood embedded in its semantics. I do not believe this analysis is notionally different from a null morpheme. It has the vice of being a little more complicated, but the virtue of not outputting any unpronounced elements in the string. The rule looks like this:

\ex
\begin{avm}
\[ \asort{neutral-3rd-pred-lex-rule}
   sysnsem.local & \[ cat & \[ head & \[ \asort{verb}

\end{avm}
\xe

Finally, the second-position clausal clitics need to be able to attach to a preceding modifier of the predicate. In the case of the main clause predicates, they may attach to preceding adverbs, and for the article they may attach to preceding adjectives. Because there is no movement in HPSG, my analysis cannot simply say that clitics ``move" into position of the leftmost item in the phrase. There are benefits to this design decision (faster computation, fidelity to the ordering of the surface string, bidirectionality of parsing and generation), but second position phenomena is one of the areas that requires extra analytical work in HPSG.

In both the cases where the mood clitic attaches to a preceding adverb (\ref{ex:2padvpred}) and when the article attaches to a preceding adjective (\ref{ex:2padjpart}), the second position enclitic containing the subject information is attaching to a modifier of a later predicate. In the version of the lexical entry seen in (\ref{ex:2p-lex-item}), these clitics are selecting for predicate complements, to which they assign semantic information (such as tense), and taking on their subject and complements. However, in the case where the clitics attach to a modifier, I cannot model the clitics as selecting for a predicate. I must have the clitic select for a modifier, and assign its semantic information to the modifier's modified value.

I create a lexical rule which creates the appropriate modifier-selecting structure from lexical entries of the type (\ref{2p-lex-item}). Because the mood enclitics are creating a structure that is a semantic event and the article enclitic is creating a structure that is a semantic referent, the manipulations done to these two categories need to be somewhat different. I have two types for this: \textsc{\textit{auxiliary-unary-type-raise-clause}} and \textsc{\textit{auxiliary-unary-type-raise-article}}. Each of these inherit common properties from a common supertype, \textsc{\textit{auxiliary-unary-type-raise-super}}, the key parts of which are replicated below.\footnote{For brevity, I have pretended in (\ref{auxiliary-unary-type-raise-super}) that I can modify the \textsc{posthead} value from + to --. In fact, in my implementation I have to copy up every other value, changing only \textsc{posthead}.}

\end{avm}}

This supertype states that type auxiliary type raising is a unary operation that takes some auxiliary which has not been type raised, marks it as type raised, and adds one item to its complements list. The item that was previously the first complement and was [\textsc{posthead} --] (that is, had to be realized to the left) is now the second complement and is [\textsc{posthead} +] (that is, realized to the right). The supertype does not say much about the added complement, as that is left for its two daughter rules, in (\ref{auxiliary-unary-type-raise-clause}) and (\ref{auxiliary-unary-type-raise-article}) below.

\ex \label{auxiliary-unary-type-raise-clause}

\end{avm}}
\xe

This rule specifies that the old subject is the same as the new subject, and the semantic value and type of the construction (the \textsc{hook}) is the same as the old one. That is to say, it is still an event, and has the same subject. The new complement introduced has a \textsc{mod} value which is identical to the second complement (what was previously the first complement). So the \textsc{\textit{auxiliary-unary-type-raise-clause}} appends a new element to the beginning of the complements list which is a modifier of the old first complement.

The article type raising rule is in (\ref{auxiliary-unary-type-raise-article}) below. It contains a few differences to account for the change in semantic type.

\ex \label{auxiliary-unary-type-raise-article}

This rule creates a noun instead of a verb. Like its sister rule, the first item on the complements list is a modifier. However, instead of that modified value being identified with the second complement, it is identified with the second complement's subject. This is because that complement can be any predicate: noun, verb, or adjective. Since predicates are events that have their referential index associated with their subject, the modifying adjective needs to grab a hold of the subject value. Related to this, the rule's semantic content (its \textsc{hook}) is identified with that modified element's hook, rather than the \textsc{hook} of the original \textit{article-lex}. With these rules in place, I can now parse sentences with a leading adverb, and participant phrases with a leading adjective.

\begin{comment}
That is, the attribute-value matrix (AVM) for the full predicate complex \textit{=ʔaqƛ=s} in (\ref{ex:2padvpred}) should look something like this:

\subsection{Second position suffixes} \label{sec:clause:analysis:2pv}

In \S\ref{sec:clause:2pv} I give some examples of second position suffixes. The two classes that I have implemented are the ``main predicate" suffixes and the ``auxiliary predicate" suffixes. I will first show my implemented analysis of the main predicate suffixes. As a reminder, all these types are partial representatives of the full type, which is present in the implemented grammar. Certain features---such as well-formedness for inflection and restricting daughter types by morphological class---are omitted in the interest of space and clarity.

\subsubsection{Main predicate suffixes}

Main predicate suffixes are the class of verbal suffixes that may attach to a noun, in which case the noun satisfies the verb's complement, an adjective, in which case the adjective modifies the verb's (possibly dropped) complement, or an adverb, in which case the adverb modifies the verb itself.

All incorporating suffixes are modeled through the application of two successive lexical rules. The first lexical rule applies to the incorporated element (the noun, adjective, adverb, or, in the case of auxiliary predicate suffixes, verb) and modifies its properties. Then the rule that attaches the suffix applies, and relates its syntactico-semantic features to the type that prepared the root for incorporation.

All of these rules share some similarities, which I abstract into a higher type, \textsc{\textit{incorporating-lex-rule}} (\ref{incorporating-lex-rule}). This rule states that all incorporation rules apply to non-auxiliaries, and create verbs that are predicative, non-root, non-finite forms. The parent node will have some non-predicative subject and no modifiers.

\ex \label{incorporating-lex-rule}
\begin{avm}
\[\asort{incorporating-lex-rule}
 synsem.local.cat & \[ val.subj & \< \[ local.cat.head.prd & -- \] \> \\
                         head & \[\asort{verb}
                                  prd & + \\
                                  aux & -- \\
                                  form & non-root-nonfinite \\
                                  mod & \< \> \] \] \\
 daughter & \[ synsem.local.cat.head.aux - \]
 \]
\end{avm}
\xe

The subtypes of \textsc{\textit{incorporating-lex-rule}} that prepare nouns, adjectives, and adverbs for incorporation are given in (\ref{noun-incorporation-lex-rule}, \ref{adj-incorporation-lex-rule}, \ref{adv-incorporation-lex-rule}) below.

\ex \label{noun-incorporation-lex-rule}
\begin{avm}
\[\asort{noun-incorporation-lex-rule}
 synsem & \[ local.cat.val.comps & \< \> \] \\
 daughter & \[ synsem.local.cat.head & \[\asort{noun}
                                          form & root \\
                                          mod & \< \> \] \]
 \]
\end{avm}
\xe

The noun incorporation rule simply states that it needs a root form noun daughter with nothing in its modifying list, and will not have any complements.

\ex \label{adj-incorporation-lex-rule}
\begin{avm}
\[\asort{adj-incorporation-lex-rule}
 synsem & \[ local.cat.val.comps & \< \[ local.cont.hook.index & \avmbox{1} \] \> \] \\
 daughter & \[ synsem.local.cat & \[ head & \[\asort{adj}
                                              form & root \] \\
                                     val.subj & \< \[ local$\ldots$index & \avmbox{1} \] \> \] \] \]
\end{avm}
\xe

The adjective incorporation rule states that it needs an adjective daughter, also in root form, and goes on to identify the adjective's subject's index with its own subject's index.

\ex \label{adv-incorporation-lex-rule}
\begin{avm}
\[\asort{adv-incorporation-lex-rule}
 synsem.local & \[ cat.val.comps & \< \[ local & \[ cat.head & \[ aux & -- \\
                                                                  type-raise & -- \] \\
                                                    cont$\ldots$xarg & \avmbox{1} \] \] \> \\
                   cont.hook & \[ xarg & \avmbox{1} \\
                                  gtop & \avmbox{2} \] \] \\
 daughter & \[ synsem.local.cat.head & \[\asort{adv}
                                         form & root \\
                                         mod & \< \[ local$\ldots$ltop & \avmbox{2} \] \> \] \] \]
\end{avm}
\xe

The adverb rule is the most complex. As before, it takes a daughter that is in root form and an adverb. It inserts a value into its complements list which is not an auxiliary and not type-raised\footnote{This is important so that certain rules not mentioned, for instance intransitive-verb-to-adjective, cannot be the complement of an incorporated adverb.}. It identifies the \textsc{xarg} of its complement---that is, the complement's subject---with its own \textsc{xarg}. The syntactic structure of incorporated adverbs is: \textit{Adv-Suff.Verb\ \ Obj}. This \textsc{xarg} identification will, down the line, have the effect of tying the suffix verb's subject to the (yet-to-be-added) complement's subject (recalling that nouns are events with a subject).

Finally, there is the identification of the daughter's modified element's \textsc{ltop} with the parent's \textsc{gtop}. I will admit this is a bit of a hack. Adverbs are, in MRS, ``quantificationally equivalent" with what they modify. This is to allow adverbs to float in the semantic interpretation, and it is modeled with a special kind of semantic relation called a qeq (or quantificational equivalency) and a type called a ``handle" which relates things quantifications. A simple semantic expression for `I only sing' then looks like (\ref{mrsising}).

\ex \label{mrsising}
\begin{avm}
\< \[\asort{only}
     lbl & \textit{h} \\
     arg0 & \textit{e} \\
     arg1 & \textit{h}\avmbox{1} \], 
     \[\asort{sing} 
       lbl & \textit{h}\avmbox{2} \\
       arg0 & \textit{e}\[tense & present\] \\
       arg1 & \textit{x}\[pernum & 1sg \] \],
     \[\asort{qeq}
       higher & \avmbox{1} \\
       lower & \avmbox{2} \] \>
\end{avm}
\xe

In the \textsc{\textit{adv-incorporation-lex-rule}} (\ref{adv-incorporation-lex-rule}), I need to preserve the adverb's semantic \textsc{lbl} value (stored in \textsc{ltop} in the syntax) so that, when the suffix verb is attached, that \textsc{lbl} from its \textsc{qeq} relation is around for me to associate with the verb. This is not what the \textsc{gtop} value is intended for, but it works, and that \textsc{gtop} is not associated with anything else once the suffix verb is applied, so no harm done.\footnote{The reader may have noticed that all my rules so far are treating the suffix verbs as though they are transitive only---there is only at most one item in the \textsc{comps} list. However, in \S\ref{sec:clause:2pv:mainpredicate} I noted one ditransitive suffix verb. I do in fact parse ditransitives in my implemented, but it requires parallel copies of all these incorporating rules, in order to account for a longer \textsc{comps} list. I pull a similar trick to the \textsc{gtop} trick here in those rules, where I temporarily store the second complement in the intermediate rule's \textsc{spec}. This is not what this list is intended for, but once again, after the suffix verb applies, that list is hidden. As with all these rules, the full versions can be seen in my implemented grammar at [[TODO: link]].}

Once one of the above rules has applied, the main predicate suffix can be added. There must be one rule for each of the lexical categories, but there is one rule for adding suffixes, given in (\ref{2p-suffix-transitive-verb-lex-rule}), which I will give a detailed explanation of.

\ex \label{2p-suffix-transitive-verb-lex-rule}
\begin{avm}

This rule introduces a new semantic relation (\textsc{c-cont}) that has not yet been assigned a semantic relation value. All this rule states is that it is an event (\textsc{arg0} \textit{e}) that relates to referents. The parent also will be an event, with its \textsc{index} being the same as the introduced relation's \textsc{arg0}. It will also inherit the relation's \textsc{arg1} as its \textsc{xarg} and its \textsc{lbl} as its \textsc{ltop} (these are standard relationships for verbs).

The rule passes up its daughter's subject and complements. All of its possible daughters will minimally have a subject, defined in the parent type (\ref{incorporating-lex-rule}). The noun incorporation rule however does not add any complements, while the adjective and adverb incorporation rules do. So a main predicate suffix applied to an incorporated noun will only have a subject, while incorporated adjectives and adverbs will have an object.

Finally, the new relation's \textsc{lbl} is identified with the daughter's \textsc{gtop}. This was only defined for incorporating adverbs, and this will have the effect of allowing the adverb to scope over the verb in the semantics.

As seen above, all that is missing is the new relation's value, the small-caps that indicates what meaning is. For instance, the suffix \textit{-naˑk} will inherit from the type \textsc{\textit{2p-suffix-transitive-verb-lex-rule}} and only add the following:

\ex \label{naakavm}
\begin{avm}
\[\asort{naˑk} c-cont & \< \[ pred & \textsc{have} \] \> \]
\end{avm}
\xe

It has already inherited the argument structure, and all the machinery tying those semantic arguments to syntactic positions in the structure. The entry for \textit{-naˑk}, as well as all the other main predicate suffix verbs, only needs to give the value of its relation. To make this more concrete, I give a derivation of the word \textit{nuuknaak} `have a song' in (\ref{nuuknaakhpsg}) below, somewhat condensed and abbreviated for space.

\subsubsection{Auxiliary predicate suffixes}

The strategy I apply to auxiliary predicate suffixes is extremely similar to that for main predicate suffixes. Like main predicate suffixes, incorporation proceeds in two steps: first a lexical rule that moves the needed syntactic properties into place, and then a final inflecting lexical rule that supplies the suffix itself. Because auxiliary predicate suffixes handle all predicates in the same way (\S\ref{sec:clause:2pv:auxiliary}), I only need two ``preparatory" lexical rules: one for predicates (\ref{pred-incorporation-lex-rule}), and one for adverbs. As with the main predicate suffixes, these lexical types inherit from \textsc{\textit{incorporating-lex-rule}} (\ref{incorporating-lex-rule}).

\ex \label{pred-incorporation-lex-rule}
\begin{avm}
\[\asort{pred-incorporation-lex-rule}
 synsem.local.cat.val & \[ subj & \< \avmbox{1} \> \\
                           comps & \avmbox{2} \] \\
 daughter & \[ synsem.local.cat \[ head & \[ prd & + \\
                                         form & non-root \] \\
                                   val & \[ subj & \< \avmbox{1} \> \\
                                            comps & \avmbox{2} \] \] \] \]
\end{avm}
\xe

This lexical rule asserts that its daughter is a predicate (a noun, adjective, or verb) and not a root form. It then passes up that word's subject and complements.

\ex \label{adv-incorporation-pred-lex-rule}
\begin{avm}
\[\asort{adv-incorporation-pred-lex-rule}
 synsem.local & \[ cat.val & \[ subj & \< local.cont.index & \avmbox{1} \> \\
                  comps & \< \[ local & \[ cat.head & \[ aux & -- \\
                                                         type-raise & -- \] \\
                                           cont.hook & \[ index & \avmbox{2} \\
                                                 xarg & \avmbox{1} \] \] \] \> \] \\
                   cont.hook & \[ index & \avmbox{2} \\
                                  gtop & \avmbox{3} \] \] \\
 daughter & \[ synsem.local & \[ cat.head & \[\asort{adv}
                                              mod & \< \[ local$\ldots$ltop & \avmbox{3} \] \> \] \\
                                 cont.hook.index & \avmbox{2} \] \] \]
\end{avm}
\xe

This rule does much of the same work that the previous adverb incorporation rule does. The modifications are that, rather than identifying the complment's \textit{index} with the mother's \textsc{xarg} (as in (\ref{adv-incorporation-lex-rule}), the complement's \textit{index} is identified with the mother's \textsc{index}. This will have the effect of allowing the adverb to modify the complement. The complement's \textsc{xarg} is also identified with the subject. This has the effect of generating the subject-control properties of the suffix. The rest of the structure is the same as in (\ref{adv-incorporation-lex-rule}), and in fact in my implementation, the commonalities are stored in an abstract type that both daughters inherit from.

Once again, a final type applies the actual suffix verb itself, this time called \textsc{\textit{2p-suffix-pred-verb-lex-rule}}. This type is once again highly similar to the version seen for main predicate suffixes in (\ref{2p-suffix-transitive-verb-lex-rule}). In fact, there is only one difference: the \textsc{arg2} of the \textsc{c-cont} is an event type rather than a referent and is identified with the daughter's \textsc{index} rather than its \textsc{xarg}. Other than that, the rules are identical. Again, I put the common restrictions in a supertype from which both subtypes inherit. The daughter subtype \textsc{\textit{2p-suffix-pred-verb-lex-rule}} with the relevant changes is given in (\ref{2p-suffix-pred-verb-lex-rule}).

\ex \label{2p-suffix-pred-verb-lex-rule}
\begin{avm}
\[\asort{2p-suffix-pred-verb-lex-rule}

\subsection{Verbal aspect} \label{sec:clause:analysis:aspect}

\section{Summary} \label{sec:clause:summary}

Because of predicate flexibility in Nuuchahnulth, I have defined special terminology to distinguish between semantic and syntactic phenomenon. I use \textit{relation} to refer to atomic semantic units and \textit{argument} to refer to the variables that those semantic units relate. I refer to syntactic \textit{predicates}, which are the position in the clause where semantic arguments may be filled. \textit{Participants} are the syntactic units that fulfill a predicate's semantic arguments, and thus correlate with semantic \textit{arguments}.

Verbs, adjectives, and common nouns may all be used predicatively, but proper nouns cannot be. All of these lexical categories can be used as participants, but verbs and adjectives require an ``article," which I argue is a relativizer. Each clause is headed by a second-position inflectional element which provides, among other things, subject agreement. Adverbs may precede the clausal predicate, in which case the second position inflection appears after the adverb.

I model syntactic predicates and participants with a boolean-valued feature [\textsc{pred} +|--]. Predicate phrases and participant phrases are defined as units that are [\textsc{pred} +] and [\textsc{pred} --] respectively. The clausal clitics, including the article, select for [\textsc{pred} +], with the article generating a [\textsc{pred} --] parent node and the other second position inflection generating [\textsc{pred} +]. The head-complement and head-subject rules select for participants by specifying that the non-head daughter is [\textsc{pred} --]. Verbs, adjectives, and common nouns are [\textsc{pred} +], while proper nouns are [\textsc{pred} --]. Common nouns may go through a unary rule that relativizes their semantics and makes them [\textsc{pred} --], and thus eligible as syntactic participants.

When participants occur to the left of the verb, they fall outside the second position of the clausal clitic complex. I model this as a gap-filler rule that places focus information on the left-dislocated element. To model the second position clitics, I have a generic \textit{clausal-inflection} type which adds its complement (the clausal predicate)'s complement list to its own. This is an analysis called \textit{argument composition}. In order to account for clitics attaching to preceding, modifying elements, I define a rule that applies only to \textit{clausal-inflection} lexemes and changes their syntactic construction so that the element adds its complement's \textsc{mod}'s complements to its own complements list. With this basic sketch of the clause and my HPSG analysis of it, I will be able to describe my understanding of serial verbs (\S\ref{sec:sv}) and the predicate linker (\S\ref{sec:link}), and how I model these phenomena.
